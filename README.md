I developed the app "SimGuard" for Yureka All Challenge and won 2nd place in the country.

This is anti-theft app designed to work specially where data/GPS might be off.

 - Read SIM info and detect sim change.
 - When SIM is changed, it sends new sim number to selected contacts via SMS
 - Add multiple emergency contacts and protect app via password
 - Works in background and starts on boot
