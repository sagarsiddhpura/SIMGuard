<h2>SIMGuard FAQ</h2>
<br>
<h4>What is SIMGuard?</h4>
<p>SIMGuard is anti-theft app specially designed for India. When a mobile is stolen, usually thief will switch it off and insert a new SIM card afterwards. SIMGuard takes advantage of this habit. Once it is setup, It will alert given emergency numbers and send new SIM information whenever SIM card is changed. Thus you can track every new mobile number and get your phone back.
</p>
<br>
<h4>How does it differ from existing anti-theft apps?</h4>
<p>
<ul class="bulletList">
<li>Existing anti theft apps are not designed for India. They need good internet connection, Wifi and GPS turned on to work. Even most used anti-theft app from Google - Android device manager needs internet and to work! Usually people never keep GPS and even mobile data on</li>
<li>Other good apps(only a few) having similar anti-theft functionality(without internet) are paid apps</li>
<li>Most of similar existing apps constantly run in memory and slow down the device. For India where common man uses average android phones having less RAM, this kind of apps slow it down more. SIMGuard does not keep running in memory and uses 0-RAM</li>
<li>Most of these apps have larger size. Again less internal storage being a problem here, people tend to uninstall largest apps first. SIMGuard is just tiny(>1 mb) and does not take a toll on memory!</li>
<li>As SIMGuard does not keep running in memory, it is 100% battery friendly</li>
</ul>
</p>
